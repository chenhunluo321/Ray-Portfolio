	       <h2>Hurricane Irma</h2>
	       <p>Hurricane Irma is an extremely powerful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone">tropical cyclone</a> currently affecting the Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico, and threatening <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba">Cuba</a> and the Southeastern United States. It is the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Wilma of 2005 in terms of maximum sustained winds, the most intense in terms of pressure since Dean in 2007, and the first of such intensity to make landfall anywhere in the Atlantic since Felix in 2007. Irma is also the first Category 5 hurricane to affect the northern Leeward Islands on record. A typical Cape Verde hurricane,[1][2][3] Irma developed on August 30 near the Cape Verde Islands from a tropical wave that had moved off the west African coast two days prior. It is the ninth named storm, fourth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season.[4][5][6]<br>

Under favorable conditions, Irma rapidly intensified shortly after formation, becoming a Category 2 hurricane within a mere 24 hours. It became a Category 3 hurricane (and therefore a major hurricane) shortly afterward; however, the intensity fluctuated for the next several days due to a series of eyewall replacement cycles. On September 5, Irma became a Category 5 hurricane, and by early the next day, Irma reached peak intensity with 185 mph (295 km/h) winds and a minimum pressure of 914 mbar (914 hPa; 27.0 inHg). This ties it as the second-strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed, surpassed only by Allen of 1980 which reached wind speeds of 190 mph (310 km/h). However, Irma sustained these 185 mph winds for 36 hours, setting a record above Allen, which had sustained 180 mph (290 km/h) winds for 18 hours. In addition, Irma achieved one of the longest durations of Category 5 strength winds on record.[7] Irma is the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic basin outside the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, and is tied with the 1935 Labor Day hurricane as the strongest landfalling cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin. In addition, Irma's low pressure makes it the strongest tropical cyclone worldwide in 2017 so far.<br>

It caused catastrophic damage in Barbuda, St. Barthelemy, St Martin, Anguilla and the Virgin Islands as a Category 5 with winds of 185 mph (295 km/h). Irma was the strongest hurricane to strike the northern Leeward Islands and one of the worst storms to hit the region, along with Hurricane Donna in 1960 and Hurricane Luis in 1995. The hurricane has caused at least 10 deaths by noon UTC on September 7.</p>

	      	<h2>Preparations</h2>
	      	<hr>
	      	<h3>Caribbean</h3>
	      	<p>Given Irma's forecast track along much of the Caribbean island chain, hurricane warnings were issued for the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico and parts of Hispaniola on September 5.[35] On September 4, Puerto Rico declared a state of emergency.[36] In Antigua and Barbuda, residents safeguarded their homes and cleaned up their properties in anticipation of strong winds. Emergency crews were put on standby at public shelters and hospitals by September 5 to assist with any evacuations.[37] Expecting a direct hit, more than half of residents on Barbuda took shelter,[38] and relief supplies were preemptively mobilized.[39] On Guadeloupe, low-lying and cliff-edge homes were evacuated at the threat of flooding and erosion. Schools and public businesses closed on September 5 and 6. Hospitals stocked up on three days' worth of supplies and checked the functionality of their generators.[40][41] Of the island's 32 municipalities, 22 activated their emergency plans; 1,500 people were urged to take shelter.[42]

Though the core of the hurricane was expected to remain north of the island, a yellow alert was issued for Martinique due to the likelihood of rough seas.[43] The island dispatched relief supplies and military reinforcements to its neighboring islands of Guadeloupe, Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy, who faced a greater risk of a direct impact.[44] The National Emergency Management Organization on Saint Lucia urged small craft operators and swimmers to be mindful of forecasts for high surf.[45] Small Craft Warnings and High Surf Advisories were hoisted for Dominica, where residents were urged to remain vigilant of the potential for high waves, landslides, and flooding.[46]

On September 6 the Dominican Republic activated the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters, thus providing for humanitarian satellite coverage.[47]</p>
	      	<h3>Mainland United States</h3>
	      	<h4>Florida</h4>
	      	<p>On September 4, Florida Governor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Scott">Rick Scott </a>declared a state of emergency for Florida,[48] and placed 100 members of the Florida National Guard on duty to assist in preparations. All 7,000 troops are to be on duty by September 8.[49] Officials advised residents to stock their hurricane kits.[50] All state offices in Florida are to be closed on Friday.[51] All schools in the Florida Keys are closed from September 6 until further notice. Mandatory evacuations for the islands are expected, with tourists to leave September 6 and residents the following day.[52] Schools are also closed in Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, Collier, Martin, Okeechobee, St. Lucie, Lee, Brevard, Pinellas, and Indian River counties on September 7 and 8.[53] On September 6, the mayor of Fort Lauderdale ordered mandatory evacuations for all residents east of US 1. The city of Tampa, on the west coast of Florida, declared a local state of emergency. [54] The University of Central Florida announced that classes would be canceled from September 7 to 11, and their Orlando campuses closed from September 8 to 11.[55] Shelters will be opening in the following counties: Broward, Flagler, Hardee, Hendry, Marion, Palm Beach, Pasco. [56] At around 15Z on September 7, a Hurricane Watch was issued for parts of deep south Florida, including the cities of Miami and Naples.</p>
	      	<h4>Georgia</h4>
	      	<p>Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency for six coastal counties on September 6, 2017.[57]</p>
	      	<h4>North Carolina</h4>
	      	<p>Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on September 6, 2017, to take effect for the entire state at 8:00 a.m. on September 7.[58]</p>
	      	<h4>South Carolina</h4>
	      	<p>Governor Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency on September 6, 2017.[59]</p>
	      	<h4>Sports</h4>
	      	<p>The University of Central Florida Knights football team moved up a home game in Orlando, Florida against the University of Memphis Tigers football team from Saturday, September 9, 2017, at 8:00 p.m. local to Friday, September 8, 2017 at 6:30 p.m. local due to Irma.[60] The Miami Dolphins–Tampa Bay Buccaneers game scheduled for September 10 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami was postponed to November 19 due to the storm potentially hitting during the teams' Week 1 matchup.[61] The University of Miami–Arkansas State University game scheduled for September 9 at Centennial Bank Stadium in Arkansas was canceled due to travel concerns for the University of Miami.[62] The University of Florida Gators football team's Saturday, September 9 contest against the Northern Colorado Bears in Gainesville, originally scheduled for 7:30 p.m. local time, was moved up to 12:00 p.m. noon that same day.[63] The Florida State University Seminoles football team's Saturday, September 9 contest against Louisiana-Monroe in Tallahassee, originally scheduled for 7:00 p.m. local time, was moved up to 12:00 noon that same day. Florida International University's football game against Alcorn State, originally scheduled for Saturday, September 9 at 7:30 PM EDT, will be played one day earlier on Friday, September 8 at 6:00 PM CDT at Legion Field in Birmingham.[64] Minor League Baseball's Florida State League called off their championship game and as a result, will name their division series players co-champions.[65]</p>
	      	<h4>FEMA funding</h4>
	      	<p>As of September 5, 2017, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency">FEMA </a>funding was running dangerously low due to its recent response to Hurricane Harvey in Texas, prompting the Trump administration to request an immediate $8 billion in additional funding as Irma approaches Florida.[66]</p>

	      <section id="impact">
	      	<h2>Impact</h2><hr>
	      	<h3>Antigua and Barbuda</h3>
	      	<p>The eyewall of the hurricane moved over Barbuda near its record peak intensity during the night of September 5–6;[67] a local anemometer reportedly measured an unofficial gust of 155 mph (250 km/h) before being blown away.[68] Though some reports of structural damage such as blown off roofs surfaced shortly after,[69] the exact state of the island remained unclear for hours after Irma's passage, as downed phone lines ceased all communication with nearby islands.[38] Later that afternoon, Prime Minister Gaston Browne surveyed the territory by helicopter, revealing an effectively uninhabitable island. Irma damaged over 90% of structures on Barbuda, completely flattening some residential blocks while submerging others.[70][71] The destruction rendered the island's sole airport and much of its infrastructure inoperative—including water and telecommunication services—which further hampered relief efforts. One infant was killed in the process of evacuating during the hurricane. Preliminary assessments on Barbuda suggest property damage of more than $100 million.[72]

Remaining just outside Irma's strongest windfield, Antigua sustained minimal damage in the form of torn roofs, downed power poles and lines, and uprooted trees. Three people were treated for minor storm-related injuries.[73]</p>
	      	<h3>Saint Martin and Saint Barthelemy</h3>
	      	<p>On the morning of September 6, Irma's extreme core crossed the island of Saint Martin, sweeping entire structures, submerging roads and cars alike, and triggering an island-wide blackout.[74] Its catastrophic Category-5 winds elevated numerous trees, vehicles, and debris from damaged structures, scattering them across the island.[75] The hurricane wreaked havoc on Princess Juliana International Airport, with "huge chunks of the building [strewn] across the runway and a jet bridge snapped in half."[76] Entire marinas were left in ruins, littered with stranded crafts smashed into one another. Images showed devastated room interiors with furniture hurled around after the winds shattered their windows.[75] A hotel caught on fire, but dangerous conditions and impassable roads prevented firefighters from putting out the blaze. Another hotel lost nearly all of its ground floor. In the aftermath of the storm, looting incidents were reported at stores.[77] Prelimary reports indicate that Irma killed six people on the island and destroyed an estimated 60–70% of its buildings.[78]

Widespread destruction and disastrous flooding has been reported in the hurricane's path, including Saint Barthélemy, though the exact extent of the impact there is unclear due to disrupted communications.[38]</p>
	      	<h3>Rest of the Leeward Islands</h3>
	      	<p>Large swells ahead of Irma washed ashore debris and sea life in Castries, Saint Lucia, blocking some roads.[79] One death occurred in Barbados after a surfer hit a reef and broke his neck.[80] The hurricane's effects, such as violent seas and rattling trees, were intense enough to be detected by seismographs in Guadeloupe.[81] Around 8,000 households and a water supply network on that island lost power during the storm, leaving several communes in the dark without running water. Overall damage was limited to trees downed onto roads and three unmanned ships wrecked by rough seas.[42] Saint Kitts &amp; Nevis endured similar conditions; blustery rainstorms triggered scattered power outages and disabled the island's water system, but the islands were spared of significant damage.[82]</p>
	      	<h3>Virgin Islands</h3>

	      	<h3>Puerto Rico</h3>
	      	<p>Two people died in Puerto Rico due to rainstorms ahead of the hurricane: one man died in Orocovis after falling off his ladder while repairing his roof; another man on the coast in Capitanejo died after being struck by lightning. Three nearby fishermen were burned by the same lightning strike, but survived.[85] More than 1 million residents lost power due to damages caused by the storm, according to Puerto Rican Governor Alejandro García Padilla.[86]</p>
